Start function named func()
func:
    push ebp
    movl ebp, esp

End function:
    movl esp, ebp
    pop ebp
    ret

Allocate room for a variable (everything is in terms of ints)
    sub esp, 4 ; The 4 is actually 4 * however many ints we need.

Use passed in variables:
Note: the first variable is the closest.
    [ebp+4]

Sample code to add 2 variables:
